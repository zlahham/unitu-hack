##Unitu Hack
###Team Name: Grid

This project was built during a mini-hackathon that took place on the 14th November at the Innovation Warehouse in London. We won third place.

You can see the live app at https://class-vote.firebaseapp.com/

This app aims to solve the problem that students face when their lecturer/tutor goes through the material faster than they can follow, or simply when the lecturer loses the attention of students at some point in the session.

This is done through giving each student/audience member the chance to upvote or downvote accordingly. The result will be a visual representation that the lecturer can see on their side of the screen, showing them each student represented by a square on a populated grid, where each square will show a colour representing their understanding at that particular moment, from a scale of Red to Green.

Technology used: Angular and Firebase.
