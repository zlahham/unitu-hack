##Unitu Hack
###Team Grid

This project was built during a mini-hackathon that took place on the 14th November at the Innovation Warehouse in London.

You can see the live app at https://class-vote.firebaseapp.com/

This app aims to solve the problem that students face when their lecturer/tutor goes faster than they can follow, or simply when the lecturer loses the attention of students at some point in the session.

Technology used: Angular and Firebase.
